# Random-Projects
Collection of random Data Science projects I worked on at the start of my journey learning in this field. Some things were done at internships, some as class projects, while some were just for fun. Most of these are really simple and beginner-friendly. The reason I created this repo was just to show my journey and how I started üòÑ So most of this work was around 2019-2021 period.

## List of Projects
- COVID-19 mortality rate and spreading speed prediction
  
  This was a machine learning project conducted while taking the course 'Special Topics in Computer Engineering'. Multiple data analysis techniques were implemented to predict the spreading speed and mortality rate of COIVD-19. We used multiple open source datasets to do our analysis and published a paper in https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJIIDS.2023.131412
  
- Malicious website detection

  Final project for the course 'Artificial Intelligence' taken in Fall 2021/2022. The project solves a classification problem where the detection of malicious websites would be achieved. The data represented features from the string URL of the website in addition to applicationa and network layers features
  
- Topic modelling

  Done at a Data Science Internship at Sitech. Different algorithm were used to cluster text data, in addition to using multiple methods to vectorize the data (bag of words, tfidft)
  
- Customer churn prediction

  Done at a Data Science Internship at Sitech. The goal was to predict customer churn using given features about them. The code is relatively short as PyCaret, a low-code python machine learning library, was mainly used
  
- PDF scanner

  Done at a Data Science Internship at Sitech. The goal was to implement OCR to identify arabic pdf documents and transform them into text data.
  
- Cat generation

  First time learning generative models. Here I implemented GANs for the first time! maybe around 2021
  
- Survey analysis

  This is a generic data analysis exercise where a simple analysis of a survey on online learning was done. I think this was when I was first learnig pandas üêº maybe around 2019
